        # -c compares file changes by checksum, not modification time
        # -h (or --human-readable) outputs numbers in a more human readable format
        # -a (or --archive) retains file attributes and permissions and recursively copies files and directories
        # -v (or --verbose): shows status output
        # -z (or --compress) Compresses file data during transfer
        # --delete deletes files from the destination that arenâ€™t found in the source (anymore)
        # -n (or --dry-run): Performs a trial run without actually making any changes
